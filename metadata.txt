name=Nominatim Locator Filter
description=This is a plugin which adds an (extra) Nominatim Locator Filter (Geocoder) to QGIS
about=Nominatim is a free Geocoder service provided by the OpenStreetMap project.

    A Locator Filter implements the fetching of data from internal or external sources.

    NOTE that the core functionality of this plugin is now also in the core of QGIS using the <tt>&gt;</tt> prefix.
    So to use the core QGIS Nominatim Locator you type <tt>"> artis"</tt> to search for 'artis'

    This plugin has some extra features.

    Because it is *NOT* allowed to use the Nominatim service as a 'search as you type' service,
    see: <a href="https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/">Nominatim Usage Policy</a>, the locator will not fire a request unless you end your string with a space or enter.
    So type <tt>"osm artis "</tt> (note the ending space).

    Some other tricks:

    To do a local search (so only within current mapcanvas extent), use <tt>&</tt> in front of your search term.
    So type <tt>"osm &artis "</tt> (note the ampersand and the ending space) when only Zoomed in on France OR on The Netherlands and see the difference.

    Nominatim itself also has some tricks: for example you can add a country code to your search term to ONLY search in that country.
    See  <tt>"osm &artis nl"</tt> versus  <tt>"osm &artis fr"</tt> (to see artis in The Netherlands or in France)

    The icons used are from the <a href="https://github.com/osm-search/nominatim-ui/tree/master/dist/mapicons">nominatim-ui project</a>
